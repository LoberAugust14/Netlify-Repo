First, I created my index.html on Sublime Text.
I started the code with <!Doctype HTML> which loaded the title code for me to put a title in. 
I titled the page Trey Lober's Netlify Assignment.
I then a "h1" inside of brackets which creates a header.
I used the header to show where I will be placing my README.md file.
